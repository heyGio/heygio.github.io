Hello!

I'm Giovanni, a PhD student at the [Image and Sound Processing Lab](https://ispl.deib.polimi.it/), Politecnico di Milano.
My research focuses on multimedia forensics, particularly on video deepfake detections methods using deep learning and computer vision methods.

I developed [midiVERTO](https://dcmlab.github.io/midiVERTO/#/), an open-source web application for interactive music visualization.
